### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Samuel, I'm a Front-end developer living nearby Paris.
I have been working in development since 2010.

I like :
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (() => ES6+)
- Typescript
- Nice UI / UX
- Agile
- And a few other things : :coffee: :video_game: :doughnut: :tropical_drink:

Currently I'm experimenting a lot of fun stuff around React, Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo, etc
